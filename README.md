# PES_ASIC_Class
# Objective
The goal of VLSI physical design for ASICs is to transform a logical design description, referred to as RTL (Register Transfer Level), into a physical layout that can be fabricated as an integrated circuit. This involves converting the circuit's conceptual functional representation into a concrete implementation that meets design constraints, performance goals, and the requirements for successful manufacturing.

# Introduction to Basic Keywords
## Introduction
- **ISA (Instruction Set Archhitecture)**
  - ISA defines the interface between a computer's hardware and its software, specifically how the processor and its components interact with the software instructions that drive the execution of tasks.
  - It encompasses a set of instructions, addressing modes, data types, registers, memory organization, and the mechanisms for executing and managing instructions.

- **RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing - Five)**.
  - It is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that has gained significant attention and adoption in the world of computer architecture and semiconductor design.
  - RISC architectures simplify the instruction set by focusing on a smaller set of instructions, each of which can be executed in a single clock cycle. This approach usually leads to faster execution of individual instructions.

## From Apps to Hardware
1. **Apps:** Application software, often referred to simply as "applications" or "apps," is a type of computer software that is designed to perform specific tasks or functions for end-users.
2. **System software:** System software refers to a category of computer software that acts as an intermediary between the hardware components of a computer system and the user-facing application software. It provides essential services, manages hardware resources, and enables the execution of application programs. System software plays a critical role in maintaining the overall functionality, security, and performance of a computer system.'
3. **Operating System:** The operating system is a fundamental piece of software that manages hardware resources and provides various services for both users and application programs. It controls tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, file system management, and user interface interaction. Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

4. **Compiler:** A compiler is a type of software tool that translates high-level programming code written by developers into assembly-level language.

5. **Assembler:** An assembler is a software tool that translates assembly language code into machine code or binary code that can be directly executed by a computer's processor.

6. **RTL:** RTL serves as an abstraction level in the design process that represents the behavior of a digital circuit in terms of registers and the operations that transfer data between them.

 7. **Hardware:** Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system or any electronic device. It encompasses all the tangible parts that make up a computing or electronic device and enable it to perform various tasks.

## Detail Description of Course Content
**Pseudo Instructions:** Pseudo-instructions are used to simplify programming, improve code readability, and reduce the number of explicit instructions a programmer needs to write. They are especially useful for common programming patterns that involve multiple instructions.
`Ex: li, mv`.

**Base Integer Instructions:** The term "base integer instructions" refers to the fundamental set of instructions that form the foundation for performing basic arithmetic, logical, and data movement operations.
`Ex: add, sub, and, or, xor, sll`.

**Multiply Extension Intructions:** The RISC-V architecture includes a set of multiply and multiply-accumulate (MAC) extension instructions that enhance the instruction set to perform efficient multiplication and multiplication-accumulate operations.
`Ex: mul, mulh, mulhu, mulhsu`.

**Single and Double Precision Floating Point Extension:** The RISC-V architecture includes floating-point extensions that provide support for both single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) floating-point arithmetic operations. These extensions are often referred to as the "F" and "D" extensions, respectively. Floating-point arithmetic is essential for handling real numbers with fractional parts and for performing accurate calculations involving decimal values.

**Application Binary Interface:** ABI stands for "Application Binary Interface." It is a set of rules and conventions that govern how software components interact with each other at the binary level. The ABI defines various aspects of program execution, including how function calls are made, how parameters are passed and returned, how memory is allocated and managed, and more.

**Memory Allocation and Stack Pointer** 
- Memory allocation refers to the process of assigning and managing memory segments for various data structures, variables, and objects used by a program. It involves allocating memory space from the system's memory pool and releasing it when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
- The stack pointer is a register used by a program to keep track of the current position of the program's execution on the call stack. 

# Labwork for RISCV Toolchain
## C Program
We wrote a C program for calculating the sum from 1 to n using a text editor, leafpad.

`leafpad sumton.c`
``` c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	int i, sum=0, n=111;
	for (i=1;i<=n; ++i) {
	sum +=i;
	}
	printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d \n",n,sum);
	return 0;
}
```

Using the gcc compiler, we compiled the program to get the output.

`gcc sumton.c`
`.\a.out`



## RISCV GCC Compiler and Dissemble

Using the riscv gcc compiler, we compiled the C program.

`riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c`

Using `ls -ltr sum1ton.c`, we can check that the object file is created.

To get the dissembled ALP code for the C program, 

`riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less` .

In order to view the main section, type 
`/main`.

Here, since we used -O1 optimisation, the number of instructions are 15.

## Application Binary Interface (ABI) Overview

An Application Binary Interface (ABI) constitutes a set of regulations that oversee the arrangement and access of functions, data structures, and system calls within a binary program or library. This framework establishes the fundamental interaction between distinct components of a program or between a program and the operating system. Noteworthy aspects of an ABI encompass:

1. Binary Harmony: ABIs ensure that binary code generated by one compiler or platform can harmonize seamlessly with code produced by another, provided they adhere to the same ABI specifications.

2. Function Calling Protocol: ABIs dictate the protocol for invoking functions, encompassing the sequence and location of arguments and return values, as well as the management of the call stack during function invocations.

3. Register Utilization: ABIs specify which registers are earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., argument passing, return values, temporary storage) and the manner in which they are managed during function calls.

4. Data Arrangement: ABIs outline the arrangement of data structures, such as structs and arrays, in memory, including guidelines for alignment and padding.

5. Exception Handling: They delineate the treatment of exceptions (e.g., hardware or software interrupts), encompassing the transition of control between user code and exception handlers.

6. System Calls: ABIs detail the manner in which programs interact with the operating system via system calls, including the mechanism for passing arguments and retrieving results.

7. Platform Neutrality: ABIs foster compatibility across distinct platforms (e.g., diverse CPU architectures or operating systems) by offering a standardized interface.

8. Dynamic Linking: They address dynamic linking aspects, including the loading and linking of shared libraries (DLLs on Windows or shared objects on Unix-based systems) during runtime.

9. Versioning: Certain ABIs incorporate mechanisms for versioning, enabling future modifications without disrupting compatibility with existing code.

10. Documentation: ABIs are typically documented and published, facilitating developers in crafting code that adheres to the ABI's specifications.

11. Toolchain Support: Compilers and assemblers are designed to produce code in accordance with the ABI, ensuring interoperability among code generated by varied tools.

12. Cross-Platform Development: ABIs hold special significance in cross-platform development, where code must execute on multiple platforms with potentially distinct hardware architectures and operating systems.

13. Security: ABIs may encompass security-related elements, such as safeguards against buffer overflows and stack vulnerabilities.

## Memory Allocation for Multi-Byte Values

Storing a 64-bit number (or any multi-byte value) in memory necessitates awareness of byte order, leading to proper byte arrangement.

Little-Endian: In little-endian format, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, while the most significant byte (MSB) is positioned at the highest memory address.

Big-Endian: Conversely, big-endian format places the most significant byte (MSB) at the lowest memory address, while the least significant byte (LSB) is located at the highest memory address.

## Load, Add and Store Instructions
Load, Add, and Store instructions are fundamental operations in computer architecture and assembly programming. They are often used to manipulate data within a computer's memory and registers.
1. **Load Instructions:**
Load instructions are used to transfer data from memory to registers. They allow you to fetch data from a specified memory address and place it into a register for further processing.

Example `ld x6, 8(x5)`

In this Example
- `ld` is the load double-word instruction.
- `x6` is the destination register.
- `8(x5)` is the memory address pointed to by register `x5` (base address + offset).
2. **Store Instructions:**
Store instructions are used to write data from registers into memory.They store values from registers into memory addresses

Example `sd x8, 8(x9)`

In this Example
- `sd` is the store double-word instruction.
- `x8` is the source register.
- `8(x9)` is the memory address pointed to by register `x9` (base address + offset).
3. Add Instructions:
  Add instructions are used to perform addition operations on registers. They add the values of two source registers and store the result in a destination register.

Example `add x9, x10, x11`

In this Example
- `add` is the add instruction.
- `x9` is the destination register.
- `x10` and `x11` are the source registers.
## 32-Registers and their ABI Names
The choice of the number of registers in a processor's architecture, such as the RISC-V RV64 architecture with its 32 general-purpose registers, involves a trade-off between various factors. While modern processors can have more registers but increasing the number of registers could lead to larger instructions, which would take up more memory and potentially slow down instruction fetch and decode.
#### ABI Names
ABI names for registers serve as a standardized way to designate the purpose and usage of specific registers within a software ecosystem. These names play a critical role in maintaining compatibility, optimizing code generation, and facilitating communication between different software components.

# Day-3
## Introduction to Open-Source Simulator iVerilog
<details>
<summary> Introduction to iVerilog Design Testbench </summary>

 - **Simulator**
   - It is a tool used for simulating the design. It looks for the changes on the input signals to evaluate the outputs.
   - If there is no change in the inputs, the simulator doesn't evaluate the outputs.
   - RTL is checked for adherence to the spec by simulating the design.
   - The tool used here is **iverilog** .

- **iVerilog**
  -  It is an open-source Verilog simulator used for testing and simulating digital circuit designs described in the Verilog hardware description language (HDL).
  -  Both the design and the testbench are fed to the simulator and it produces a vcd (value change dump) file.
  -  In order to view the vcd file, we use the GTKwave where we can see the wave forms.
    
   ![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/f7599d98-700e-45de-b81d-fb29f5e73228)


- **Design**
  - It is the actual verilog code or set of verilog codes which ahs the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications.
  - Verilog is used to describe the behavior and structure of digital circuits at different levels of abstraction, from high-level system descriptions down to low-level gate-level representations. 

- **Testbench**
  - A testbench is a specialized Verilog module or program used to verify the functionality and behavior of another Verilog module, circuit, or design. Testbenches are essential for testing and simulating digital designs before they are synthesized or manufactured as physical chips.
  - It is a setup to apply stimulus to the design to check its functionality.

## Introduction to Yosys and Logic Synthesis

<details>
<summary> Introduction to Yosys </summary>

+ **Synthesizer**
  - It is a tool used for converting RTL design code to netlist.
  - Here, the synthesizer used is **Yosys**.

+ **Yosys**
  - It is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis and formal verification.
  - Yosys provides a collection of tools and algorithms that enable designers to transform high-level RTL (Register Transfer Level) descriptions of digital circuits into optimized gate-level representations suitable for physical implementation on hardware.

![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/7e0da99d-f2e5-40e0-8506-d4e2f348ba39)


   - Design and .lib files are fed to the synthesizer to get a netlist file.
   - **Netlist** is the representation of the design in the form of standard cells in the .lib
     
+ Commands used to perform different opertions:
  - `read_verilog` to read the design
  - `read_liberty` to read the .lib file
  - `write_verilog` to write out the netlist file
 
+ To verify the synthesis

![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/95c48d2c-77b2-4afe-8d65-42442273a0b9)


   - Netlist along with the tesbench is fed to the iverilog simulator.
   - The vcd file generated is fed to the gtkwave simulator.
   - The output on the simulator must be same as the output observed during RTL simulation.
   - Same RTL testbench can be used as the primary inputs and primary outputs remain same between the RTL design and synthesised netlist.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Introduction to Logic Synthesis </summary>

+ **Logic Synthesis**
  - Logic synthesis is a process in digital design that transforms a high-level hardware description of a digital circuit, typically in a hardware description language (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL, into a lower-level representation composed of logic gates and flip-flops.
  - The goal of logic synthesis is to optimize the design for various criteria such as performance, area, power consumption, and timing.

 + **.lib**
   - It is a collection of logical modules like And, Or, Not etc.
   - It has different flavors of same gate like 2 input AND gate, 3 input AND gate etc with different performace speed.
  
+ **Why different flavors  of gate?**
  - In order to make a circuit faster, the clock frequency should be high.
  - For that, the time period of the clock should be as low as possible.
  
![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/a83a47a8-f7ab-4593-bf22-f89207f61fe3)


+ In a sequential circuit, clock period depends on:
  - Clock to Q of flip-flop A.
  - Propagation delay of combinational circuit.
  - Setup time of flip-flop B.

![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/b76e10fb-0e15-4fdc-a793-d9c08f27306a)


+ **Why need fast and slow cells?**
  - To ensure that there are no HOLD issues at flip-flop B, we require slow cells.
  - For a smaller propagation time, we need faster cells.
  - The collection forms the .lib

+ **Faster Cells vs Slower Cells**
  - Load in digital circuit is of Capacitence.
  - Faster the charging or dicharging of capacitance, lesser is the cell delay.
  - However, for a quick charge/ discharge of capacitor, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current i.e, we need **wide transistors**.
  - Wider transistors have lesser delay but consume more area and power.
  - Narrow transistors have more delay but consume less area and performance.
  - Faster cells come with a cost of area and power.
 
+ **Selection of the Cells**
  - We have to guide the Synthesizer to choose the flavour of cells that is optimum for implementation of logic circuit.
  - More use of faster cells leads to bad circuit in terms of power and area and also hold time violations.
  - More use of slower cells leads to sluggish circuits amd may not meet the performance needs.
  - Hence the guidance is offered to the synthesiser in the form of **constraints**.

## Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis
<details>
<summary> Hierarchical Synthesis Flat Synthesis </summary>	

**Hierarchical Synthesis**
  Hierarchical synthesis is an approach in digital design and logic synthesis where complex designs are broken down into smaller, more manageable modules or sub-circuits, and each module is synthesized individually. These synthesized modules are then integrated back into the overall design hierarchy. This approach helps manage the complexity of large designs and allows designers to work on different parts of the design independently.
  
+ The file we used in this lab is `multiple_modules.v`

  - `cd vsd/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files`
  -  `gvim multiple_modules.v`

![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/79ce7003-698b-4803-9a21-3d91d534ccce)

 **Flattened Synthesis**
  Flattened synthesis is the opposite of hierarchical synthesis. Instead of maintaining the hierarchical structure of the design during synthesis, flattened synthesis combines all modules and sub-modules into a single, flat representation. This means that the entire design is synthesized as a single unit, without preserving the modular organization present in the original high-level description.

## Various Flop Coding Styles and Optimization
<details>
<summary> Why Flops and Flop Coding Styles</summary>	

**Why do we need a Flop?**

+ A flip-flop (often abbreviated as "flop") is a fundamental building block in digital circuit design.
+ It's a type of sequential logic element that stores binary information (0 or 1) and can change its output based on clock signals and input values.
+ In a combinational circuit, the output changes after the propagation delay of the circuit once inputs are changed.
+ During the propagation of data, if there are different paths with different propagation delays, then a glitch might occur.
+ There will be multiple glitches for multiple combinational circuits.
+ Hence, we need flops to store the data from the combinational circuits.
+ When a flop is used, the output of combinational circuit is stored in it and it is propagated only at the posedge or negedge of the clock so that the next combinational circuit gets a glitch free input thereby stabilising the output.
+ We use control pins like **set** and **reset** to initialise the flops.
+ They can be synchronous and asynchronous.

**D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset**
+ When the reset is high, the output of the flip-flop is forced to 0, irrespective of the clock signal.
+ Else, on the positive edge of the clock, the stored value is updated at the output.

 `gvim dff_asyncres_syncres.v`

**D Flip_Flop with Asynchronous Set**
+ When the set is high, the output of the flip-flop is forced to 1, irrespective of the clock signal.
+ Else, on positive edge of the clock, the stored value is updated at the output.

`gvim dff_async_set.v`

![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/461ad388-4247-46b9-bdfe-a9c967725f84)


**D Flip-Flop with Synchronous Reset**
+ When the reset is high on the positive edge of the clock, the output of the flip-flop is forced to 0.
+ Else, on the positive edge of the clock, the stored value is updated at the output.

  `gvim dff_syncres.v`

![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/54f21dcc-8411-42bc-9324-e36e3a8a33cf)


**D Flip-Flop with Asynchronous Reset and Synchronous Reset**
+ When the asynchronous resest is high, the output is forced to 0.
+ When the synchronous reset is high at the positive edge of the clock, the output is forced to 0.
+ Else, on the positive edge of the clock, the stored value is updated at the output.
+ Here, it is a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous reset DFF.

# Day 5
## Introduction to Optimisations 

<details>
<summary> Combinational Optimisation </summary>
	
+ Combinational logic refers to logic circuits where the outputs depend only on the current inputs and not on any previous states.
+ Combinational optimization is a field of study in computer science and operations research that focuses on finding the best possible solution from a finite set of options for problems that involve discrete variables and have no inherent notion of time.
+ Optimising the combinational logic circuit is squeezing the logic to get the most optimized digital design so that the circuit finally is area and power efficient.
+ Techniques for Optimisations:
  - **Constant propagation** is an optimization technique used in compiler design and digital circuit synthesis to improve the efficiency of code and circuit implementations by replacing variables or expressions with their constant values where applicable.
  - **Boolean logic optimization**, also known as logic minimization or Boolean function simplification, is a process in digital design that aims to simplify Boolean expressions or logic circuits by reducing the number of terms, literals, and gates required to implement a given logical function.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Sequential Logic Optimisations </summary>	

+ Sequential logic optimizations involve improving the efficiency, performance, and resource utilization of digital circuits that include memory elements like flip-flops and latches.
+ Optimizing sequential logic is crucial in ensuring that digital circuits meet timing requirements, consume minimal power, and occupy the least possible area while maintaining correct functionality.
+ Optimisation methods:
  - **Sequential constant propagation**, also known as constant propagation across sequential elements, is an optimization technique used in digital design to identify and propagate constant values through sequential logic elements like flip-flops and registers. This technique aims to replace variable values with their known constant values at various stages of the logic circuit, optimizing the design for better performance and resource utilization.
  - **State optimization**, also known as state minimization or state reduction, is an optimization technique used in digital design to reduce the number of states in finite state machines (FSMs) while preserving the original functionality.
  - **Sequential logic cloning**, also known as retiming-based cloning or register cloning, is a technique used in digital design to improve the performance of a circuit by duplicating or cloning existing registers (flip-flops) and introducing additional pipeline stages. This technique aims to balance the critical paths within a circuit and reduce its overall clock period, leading to improved timing performance and better overall efficiency.
  - **Retiming** is an optimization technique used in digital design to improve the performance of a circuit by repositioning registers (flip-flops) along its paths to balance the timing and reduce the critical path delay. The primary goal of retiming is to achieve a shorter clock period without changing the functionality of the circuit.

# Day 6
## GLS Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch and Blocking Non-blocking Statements

<details>
<summary> GLS Concepts And Flow Using Iverilog </summary>	

 + **Gate Level Simualtion**
   - Gate-level simulation is a technique used in digital design and verification to validate the functionality of a digital circuit at the gate-level implementation.
   - It involves simulating the circuit using the actual logic gates and flip-flops that make up the design, as opposed to higher-level abstractions like RTL (Register Transfer Level) descriptions.
   - This type of simulation is typically performed after the logic synthesis process, where a high-level description of the design is transformed into a netlist of gates and flip-flops.
   - We perform this to verify logical correctness of the design after synthesizing it. Also ensuring the timing of the design is met.
  
![image](https://github.com/Sbj3333/pes_asic_class/assets/95922889/77af3fa2-a84b-4b43-83a6-e3758096ac6f)


+ **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch**
  - A synthesis-simulation mismatch refers to a situation in digital design where the behavior of a circuit, as observed during simulation, doesn't match the expected or desired behavior of the circuit after it has been synthesized.
  - This discrepancy can occur due to various reasons, such as timing issues, optimization conflicts, and differences in modeling between the simulation and synthesis tools.
  - This mismatch is a critical concern in digital design because it indicates that the actual hardware implementation might not perform as expected, potentially leading to functional or timing failures in the fabricated chip.

+ **Blocking Statements**
  - Blocking statements are executed sequentially in the order they appear in the code and have an immediate effect on signal assignments.
  - Example:

  ``` v
   module BlockingExample(input A, input B, input C, output Y, output Z);
    wire temp;

    // Blocking assignment
    assign temp = A & B;

    always @(posedge C) begin
        // Blocking assignment
        Y = temp;
        Z = ~temp;
    end
   endmodule
  ```

+ **Non-Blocking Statements**
  - Non-blocking assignments are used to model concurrent signal updates, where all assignments are evaluated simultaneously and then scheduled to be updated at the end of the time step.
  - Example:
   ``` v
    module NonBlockingExample(input clock, input D, input reset, output reg Q);

    always @(posedge clock or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            Q <= 0;  // Reset the flip-flop
        else
            Q <= D;  // Non-blocking assignment to update Q with D on clock edge
    end
  endmodule
   ```

+ **Caveats with Blocking Statements**
  + Blocking statements in hardware description languages like Verilog have their uses, but there are certain caveats and considerations to be aware of when working with them. Here are some important caveats associated with using blocking statements:
    - Procedural Execution: Blocking statements are executed sequentially in the order they appear within a procedural block (such as an always block). This can lead to unexpected behavior if the order of execution matters and is not well understood.
    - Lack of Parallelism: Blocking statements do not accurately represent the parallel nature of hardware. In hardware, multiple signals can update concurrently, but blocking statements model sequential behavior. As a result, using blocking statements for modeling complex concurrent logic can lead to incorrect simulations.
    - Race Conditions: When multiple blocking assignments operate on the same signal within the same procedural block, a race condition can occur. The outcome of such assignments depends on their order of execution, which might lead to inconsistent or unpredictable behavior.
    - Limited Representation of Hardware: Hardware systems are inherently concurrent and parallel, but blocking statements do not capture this aspect effectively. Using blocking assignments to model complex combinational or sequential logic can lead to models that are difficult to understand, maintain, and debug.
    - Combinatorial Loops: Incorrect use of blocking statements can lead to unintentional combinational logic loops, which can result in simulation or synthesis errors.
    - Debugging Challenges: Debugging code with many blocking assignments can be challenging, especially when trying to track down timing-related issues.
    - Not Suitable for Flip-Flops: Blocking assignments are not suitable for modeling flip-flop behavior. Non-blocking assignments (<=) are generally preferred for modeling flip-flop updates to ensure accurate representation of concurrent behavior.
    - Sequential Logic Misrepresentation: Using blocking assignments to model sequential logic might not capture the intended behavior accurately. Sequential elements like registers and flip-flops are better represented using non-blocking assignments.
    - Synthesis Implications: The behavior of blocking assignments might not translate well during synthesis, leading to potential mismatches between simulation and synthesis results.
